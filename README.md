# RSA
# RSA Encryption Implementations

This repository contains implementations of RSA encryption using different padding schemes in both Rust and Python.

## Rust Implementations

### RSA with OAEP

#### Implementation with Inbuilt Libraries
- This Rust program utilizes the inbuilt cryptographic libraries to implement RSA encryption with Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP).

#### Custom Implementation without Inbuilt Libraries
- This Rust program provides a custom implementation of RSA encryption with OAEP padding, showcasing a deeper understanding of the algorithm without relying on standard libraries.

## Python Implementation

### RSA with PKCS Padding
- This Python program demonstrates RSA encryption with PKCS padding, leveraging the rich cryptographic libraries available in Python.

## Usage
- For Rust implementations, simply run `cargo run` in the respective directories.
- For the Python implementation, execute `python rsa_pkcs_padding.py`.
